# SHOUTCLOUD_NODE

IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE CLOUD THAN NODE.JS, AND NODE.JS GOT EVEN MORE WEBSCALE CLOUD WITH ~~NON~~BLOCKING toUpperCase()

## TO INSTALL

```
npm install shoutcloud
```

## TO USE

`¯\_(⊙︿⊙)_/¯` REQUIRE SOME JS BY YOUR PREFERRED METHOD. `String.prototype.toUpperCase()` WILL NOW WORK VIA THE POWER OF BLOCKING CALLS TO NANOSERVICES (MICROSERVICES ARE THE NEW MONOLITHS THAT WE MUST BURN IN PURSUIT OF TRUE WEBSCALE CLOSE TO THE METAL)
